    "The Depth-First Search (DFS) solution works for this problem because it explores each path from the root to the leaves in a deep manner, following the tree structure until it reaches a leaf node and then backtracking to explore other paths. DFS explores a tree by going as deep as possible down one branch (following a path from the root) before it backtracks and explores the other branches. This process aligns perfectly with the task of finding all root-to-leaf paths.\n",
    "As DFS explores each node, it accumulates the node's value in a path list. When a leaf node is reached (a node with no left or right children), the path leading to that node is fully formed and can be added to the result list. DFS uses recursion, which allows the function to \"remember\" its state as it dives deeper into the tree. Each recursive call takes care of one level of the tree, and the state (the path up to that point) is naturally passed along to the next level. The recursive call stack implicitly handles backtracking—when DFS reaches a leaf, it naturally pops back up to the previous level and continues the exploration. This makes the DFS approach a natural fit for problems that require backtracking (like this one).\n"

    "You are given the root of a binary tree, and the goal is to find all paths from the root to any leaf node (i.e., nodes with no children).\n",

    "Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an alternative method to solve this problem. BFS is typically used for level-wise traversal of a tree, which can be particularly useful when you want to explore all possible paths from the root to the leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm Overview:\n",
    "Start from the root: Begin by enqueueing the root node and initializing an empty list to store the paths.\n",
    "Use a queue: Instead of recursion or maintaining a call stack, we will use a queue (FIFO) to keep track of nodes to explore. Each element in the queue will be a tuple containing a node and the current path taken to reach that node.\n",

    "If it is a leaf node (no left or right children), add the current path to the result list.\n",
    "If the node has a left or right child, enqueue these children along with the updated path that includes the child’s value.\n",
    "Terminate when the queue is empty: The BFS will continue until all possible root-to-leaf paths are explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Considerations:\n",
    "The queue will hold nodes and their respective paths. In the worst case, the queue may hold all the nodes at the last level of the tree. For a perfectly balanced tree, this would be about half of the total nodes in the tree (which could be O(N) in a very wide tree).\n",
    "This approach avoids recursion, so you don't have to worry about stack overflow with very deep trees, which can be a concern with DFS in extremely unbalanced trees.\n",
