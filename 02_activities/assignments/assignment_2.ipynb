    "Strengths of the Solution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Handling Edge Case:\n",
    "The solution correctly handles the edge case where the input list is empty by returning -1. This is a good practice to ensure the code does not break when no numbers are provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a Boolean Array for Tracking:\n",
    "The use of a boolean array seen to track the presence of numbers is an efficient way to mark which numbers are already present. This avoids the need for multiple iterations or complex data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution is well-structured with clear, logical steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Areas for Improvement:\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity of the Boolean Array:\n",
    "The space complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the largest number in the input list (max_value). This could be inefficient when the range of numbers is large, especially if the list contains only a few numbers. Instead of using a boolean array that might consume a lot of space, we can look into more space-efficient methods like in-place marking or using a set. But that apporach has its own downsides, as we figured in code example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity:\n",
    "Finding the maximum value in the list takes O(k) time, where k is the size of the input list. This is fine for small inputs, but for very large ranges, we can minimize extra steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boolean Array Iteration:\n",
    "The iteration to check for missing numbers in the boolean array takes O(n) time, where n is the maximum value. This adds overhead when the list contains only a small number of elements.\n",
    "Unnecessary Range of Numbers:\n",
    "The use of max_value + 1 in both the boolean array and the iteration step may be redundant if the numbers are sparse or range over a much smaller set than the largest number.\n",
    "Improved Version: In-Place Marking with List\n",
    "We can improve the space complexity by using an in-place marking approach, which avoids the need for an extra boolean array and reduces the space complexity to O(1), aside from the input list. This approach is particularly useful when the range of numbers is large.\n",

    "Key Differences & Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "In-Place Swapping:\n",
    "Instead of using a boolean array, we use in-place swapping to position the numbers at their correct index. If nums[i] is within the range [0, n-1], we place it at its correct position nums[nums[i]]. This avoids extra memory allocation for a boolean array.\n",
    "This technique ensures that numbers are \"marked\" at their correct positions in the list itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space Complexity:\n",
    "The space complexity is reduced to O(1) (constant space) because we no longer require additional space for the seen array. The input list is modified in-place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity:\n",
    "The time complexity remains O(n) because we perform the in-place swaps only once per number, and the final pass through the list takes linear time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficiency:\n",
    "By eliminating the boolean array and using in-place operations, the solution becomes more memory-efficient. This is especially beneficial when dealing with large datasets or ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Thoughts:\n",
    "The original solution was good but could be optimized in terms of space usage. The in-place marking approach reduces memory usage and still runs in linear time, making it a more efficient solution overall.\n",
    "The space complexity of O(1) is achieved by modifying the input list directly, which is particularly important for large datasets."
